    Set recommended parameters for SEED_SIZE, MIN_SEEDS, SEED_GAP for 
    fast (more misses, fast runtime), efficient (med misses, med runtime)
    or sensitive (few misses, slow) runs. 
    fast=17,5,2, efficient=14,4,2, sensitive=11,3,1. Passing values for the
    SEED_SIZE, MIN_SEEDS or SEED_GAP parameters will override these settings.
