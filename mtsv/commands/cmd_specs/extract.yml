    Include all descendant taxa in extracted queries. Queries are 
    extracted before roll up, so by default, descendant taxa will be
    included in search if a higher level taxid is provided. If False,
    only exact matches to taxid will be returned and likely no matches 
    to higher level taxids will be found.
