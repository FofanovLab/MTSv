**Heatmap**

==============


The heatmap shows the statistically significant taxids across all samples.
Significant *genus-level* taxids are only shown if none of the species in the genus are significant.
The abundance is an estimate of average coverage using the ratio of **Weighted_Support**/**Unique_Weighted_Support**.
User provided **kwargs** can change the clustering method and the standardization otherwise
`seaborn clustermap <https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html>`_ defaults are used.
